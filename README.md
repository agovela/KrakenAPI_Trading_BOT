Features
Automated trading on Kraken Pro using your API keys.

Risk management: Supports stop-loss, take-profit, trailing stops, and concurrent trade limits.

How It Works
Connect to Kraken Pro:
Enter your API credentials (stored securely in Kraken_API.json).
Select Trading Pairs:
Choose which pairs to trade, or let the bot auto-select based on your strategy.
Choose a Strategy:
Select from built-in or custom strategies. The bot will analyze the market and execute trades based on your chosen logic.
Automated Trading Loop:
The bot fetches market data, analyzes signals, places buy/sell orders, and manages open positions according to your risk settings.
Monitor and Adjust:
Use the GUI to monitor trades, update parameters, and view performance metrics.
Creating Your Own Strategies
Strategies are Python scripts stored in the strategies/ folder.

Each strategy must implement a function like:
def select_top_pairs(market_data: dict) -> list:
    # market_data: {pair: pandas.DataFrame of OHLCV data}
    # Return a list of pairs to trade this cycle
    ...
    
You can use any technical indicators, price action, or custom logic.
To add a new strategy:
1.Create a new .py file in the strategies/ folder (e.g., my_strategy.py).
2.Implement the select_top_pairs function.
3.Use the GUI "Refresh" button to load your new strategy.

Buying and Selling Logic
Buy Process:
The bot will place a buy order when your strategy signals a buy (e.g., breakout, MA crossover, RSI, etc.), and all risk checks (like available balance, min trade size, and concurrent trade limits) are passed.
Sell Process:
The bot will sell when your strategy signals a sell, or when a stop-loss, take-profit, or trailing stop is triggered.
Order Types Supported:
  Market
  Limit
  Stop-loss
  Trailing-stop
Contingencies & Risk Management
Stop-Loss:
Automatically sells if the price drops below your set threshold.
Take-Profit:
Automatically sells if the price rises above your set threshold.
Trailing Stop:
Locks in profits as the price moves in your favor.
Concurrent Trades Limit:
Restricts the number of open trades at any time.
Ignored Pairs:
The bot will skip pairs with open manual trades or those blacklisted due to errors.
Demo Mode:
Test your strategies with simulated funds before going live.
